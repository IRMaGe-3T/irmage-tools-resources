# Welcome to the neuroimaging-tools-resources wiki!

The aim is to identify the information that seems necessary and important, around the processing of the data, at the moment mainly oriented towards MRI. This is only the beginning of this work. We do not intend to be exhaustive, and there will necessarily be a more or less arbitrary choice made to offer what seems important without falling into an enumeration that would lose all interest for the reader.

The scope of this inventory goes far beyond Mia or even populse, but it will contain a lot of information necessary to use populse.
