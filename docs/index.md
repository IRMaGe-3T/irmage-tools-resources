# Welcome to the neuroimaging-tools-resources wiki of the populse's team!

The aim is to identify the information that seems necessary and important, around the processing of the data, at the moment mainly oriented towards MRI. This is only the beginning of this work. We do not intend to be exhaustive, and there will necessarily be a more or less arbitrary choice made to offer what seems important without falling into an enumeration that would lose all interest for the reader.

This wiki is hosted by the populse's team. 
[Populse](https://populse.github.io/) is a project aimed to provide pipeline calculation tools to the neuroimaging community. 
However, the scope of this inventory goes far beyond populse, but it will contain a lot of information necessary to use populse.

## How to contribute to the project ? 

* Clone [github project](https://github.com/populse/neuroimaging-tools-resources)

* Add or modify [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (.md) files 

* Add new files in `index.md` and update the `nav` (navigation) part of `mkdocs.yml` file.
