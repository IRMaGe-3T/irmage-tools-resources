fMRIPrep is an application for the preprocessing of tast-based and resting-state functional MRI:

→ perform basic processing steps as coregistration, normalization, unwarping, noise component extraction, segmentation, skull-stripping, slice-timing, susceptibility distortion correction
→ generate preprocessing quality reports
→ image docker available (no need to have third party software)
