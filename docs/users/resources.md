Please note that this resources are not exhaustive.

## MRI physics
- [IMAIOS e-MRI](https://www.imaios.com/fr/e-mri): basic online course about MRI
- [Questions and Answers in MRI](https://www.mriquestions.com/index.html): advanced information about MRI

## General information about neuroimaging software
- [Neuroimaging Tools & Resources Collaboratory (NITRC)](https://www.nitrc.org/) : a website that offers comprehensive information on an ever expanding scope of neuroinformatics software and data. You can find a lot of software and usefull link in the Resources Registry part. 

## Software suite
- [BrainVisa](https://brainvisa.info/web/): neuroimaging software platform for mass data analysis. Contains software as Morphologist (brain segmentation and sulcal analysis)
- [populse_mia](https://populse.github.io/populse_mia/html/index.html): image processing environment mainly targeted at the analysis and visualization of large amounts of MRI data.

## Data sharing and data format
- [openNeuro](https://openneuro.org/): a free platform to share BIDS-compilant data. 
- [BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/): a standardized format for organizing and describing neuroimaging data and study outputs. See also [here](BIDS.md)
- [dcm2niix](https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix): conversion of DICOM into NIfTI format (and with a json file for each NIfTI).

## Data Viewer
- [Anatomist](https://brainvisa.info/web/anatomist.html): data visualization and library of high-level neuroimaging graphical components.
- [FSLeyes](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSLeyes): image viewer.

## Functional MRI
- [Andy's Brain Book](https://andysbrainbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Andy's brain videaos](https://www.andysbrainblog.com/videos): tutorial abour fMRI processing and others neuroimaging tools 
- [mumforbrainstats](https://www.youtube.com/@mumfordbrainstats): video about fMRI processing by Jeanner Mumford
- [pratciCal fMRI blog](https://practicalfmri.blogspot.com/): a blog with tips about fMRI

## MRI Quality Control 
- [mriqc](https://mriqc.readthedocs.io/): quality control of functional fMRI and structural (T1w and T2w) data, extraction of no-reference IQMs (image quality metrics). See also [here](mriqc.md)
- [VisualQC](https://raamana.github.io/visualqc/readme.html#visualqc) : assessing and assuring the quality of imaging data, be it an raw acquisition (fMRI run or T1w MRI) or an automatic segmentation (be it gray or white surfaces for cortical thickness, or a subcortical segmentation) requires visual inspection manually.
