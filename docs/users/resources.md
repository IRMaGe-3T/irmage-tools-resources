Please note that this resources are not exhaustive.

## MRI physics
- [IMAIOS e-MRI](https://www.imaios.com/fr/e-mri): basic online course about MRI
- [Questions and Answers in MRI](https://www.mriquestions.com/index.html): advanced information about MRI

## General information about neuroimaging studies 
- Article: [Recommendations for the implementation of multicenter studies with MRI](https://www.em-consulte.com/article/1446634/recommandations-pour-la-mise-en-place-d-etudes-mul) (in French)
- Article: [Longitudinal multi-centre brain imaging studies: guidelines and practical tips for accurate and reproducible imaging endpoints and data sharing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6323670/)

## Network
- [REMI](https://remi.network): French multicenter MRI network ("RÃ©seau d'Entraide Multicentrique en IRM"). 

## MRI Quality Control 
- [mriqc](https://mriqc.readthedocs.io/): quality control of functional fMRI and structural (T1w and T2w) data, extraction of no-reference IQMs (image quality metrics). See also [here](mriqc.md)
- [VisualQC](https://raamana.github.io/visualqc/readme.html#visualqc) : assessing and assuring the quality of imaging data, be it an raw acquisition (fMRI run or T1w MRI) or an automatic segmentation (be it gray or white surfaces for cortical thickness, or a subcortical segmentation) requires visual inspection manually. 

## Data sharing and data format
- [openNeuro](https://openneuro.org/): a free platform to share BIDS-compilant data. 
- [ida loni](https://ida.loni.usc.edu): access to several database such as ADNI, ABIDE, PMI
- [BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/): a standardized format for organizing and describing neuroimaging data and study outputs. See also [here](BIDS.md)
- [dcm2niix](https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix): conversion of DICOM into NIfTI format (and with a json file for each NIfTI).

## Data Viewer
- [Anatomist](https://brainvisa.info/web/anatomist.html): data visualization and library of high-level neuroimaging graphical components.
- [FSLeyes](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSLeyes): image viewer.

## General information about neuroimaging software
- [Neuroimaging Tools & Resources Collaboratory (NITRC)](https://www.nitrc.org/) : a website that offers comprehensive information on an ever expanding scope of neuroinformatics software and data. You can find a lot of software and useful link in the Resources Registry part.
